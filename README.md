2020 marked a significant year for Ken's YouTube journey, with an impressive 113 video uploads. However, this number decreased to 47 in 2021. A closer examination of video metrics reveals intriguing patterns.

Notably, the CPM (USD) distribution centers around $10, suggesting potential earnings per thousand views from ads. Yet, for a clearer revenue picture, RPM (USD) distribution is crucial due to YouTube's substantial share. Ken's videos predominantly yield an RPM of approximately $5, a more accurate indicator of generated revenue.

One video that stands out is "How I would Learn Data Science (if I Had to Start Over)" with around 47k likes, emerging as Ken's most viewed and appreciated content. The strong correlation between Views and Subscribers gained/lost aligns with expectations. Interestingly, videos like "Why I Quit Data Science" exhibit substantial Subscriber loss but don't appear among top Subscribers gained, as they often receive mixed engagement.

Views predominantly originate from the United States (1,354,450) and India (1,155,510), contributing to Ken's channel's million total views.

**Recommendation:** Collaborations with fellow YouTubers/Content Creators could greatly benefit Ken. Given the growing Data Science community's expanding interest, live collaborations could attract new audiences to Ken's channel, driving exploration of older content and encouraging subscriptions.

*In summary,* this analysis delved into a limited set of metrics. Different metrics may matter based on a creator's audience, subject, and goals. Expect potential updates and improvements in the future as I continue exploring YouTube analytics.
